# 1.1
+ Aspects are now ingredients, they can be searched en JEI, see what 2 aspects make another aspect and what items create that aspect.
+ Arcane Workbench has a clickable area to check recipes and you can transfer recipes from the items in your inventory.
+ Fixed some recipes not working
+ WARNING: Checking what aspects all the items in the game has can be performance heavy but it won't add load time to the pack,, everything is done in a new thread and it might take a while to appear in game. Example: All The Mods 1.10 takes 3 min to check the aspects of all the items
