A JEI and Thaumcraft addon that displays thaumcraft recipes in JEI.
 

## Currently Implemented
+ Arcane Workbench
+ Crucible
+ Infusion
+ Aspect combination
+ Aspects from Items information (WARNING: On the first run a file will generate in the config folder that contains all the information for it (You can check the logs to see when is done generating). On the second run the aspects will show in JEI properly and the file will update again. The file is created in another thread so it won't slow down the game start.)

## Features Planned
+ Hide recipes in JEI if you don't have the research for it
